# 1260-Project
Repository for our group project files

Main Branch is current as of 4/21 2:15 PM. 

Consumables have been added and work.

JOptionPane is now standard across the files for dialogue; combat and deck building use console (intentional).

Minions and Minion cutscenes added. Currently have a few scattered into the DirectionChoice.java flow, but they're meant to be random.
