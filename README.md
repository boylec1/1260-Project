# 1260-Project
Repository for our group project files

Main Branch is current as of 4/21 3:17 PM. 

Consumables have been added and work.

JOptionPane is now standard across the files for dialogue; combat and deck building use console (intentional).

Minions and Minion cutscenes added. Currently have a few scattered into the DirectionChoice.java flow, but they're meant to be random. 

Names in Card.java have been standardized at 5 characters so we can have the consistent card shape in the console while not needing a base card name. For some reason that wasn't working, so I just expanded the 5-character names list and got rid of the rest. 

Events are randomized so you either get a random item or fight a random minion
